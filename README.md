# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Comparison
Alzheimer's Disease Comparison between different Deep CNN models
<br>
Our Approach is 5-way CNN classifier
The classification is based on 5 severity levels:
<ul>
  <li>Non-Demented</li>
  <li>Very Mild Demented</li>
  <li>Mild Demented</li>
  <li>Moderate Demented</li>
  <li>No (Control)</li>
  
</ul>
